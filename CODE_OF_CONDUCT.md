## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not
aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any
contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including but not limited
to repositories, issue trackers, pull requests, and discussions. It also applies
in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

---

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project maintainers privately.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response
that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The maintainers
are obligated to respect the privacy and confidentiality of the reporter.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith
may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by the project
leadership.

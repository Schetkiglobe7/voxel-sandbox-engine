Please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact

## Scope of Security Issues

Security reports may include, but are not limited to:
- Vulnerabilities leading to crashes or denial of service
- Data corruption or unintended data exposure
- Unsafe handling of external input or assets
- Misuse of database connections or credentials
- Unsafe native library loading

## Disclosure Policy

Security issues will be investigated as quickly as possible.

If a vulnerability is confirmed:
- A fix will be prepared privately
- A public disclosure may follow after a fix is available
- Credit may be given to the reporter, if desired

## Final Notes

This project is experimental and evolves incrementally.
